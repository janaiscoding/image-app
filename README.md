# Image-app.

Issue: Storing images in a db as buffer takes a huge load on the performance and response time when doing API calls. 
Solution: Use a cloud-based platform for storing and manipulating files uploaded by users.
Implementation: Add [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to my project, this is just a dummy version to learn how to deal with it for now.
